## **Background and Objectives**

Currently, the demand for EDA talents still exceeds the supply, and the threshold for EDA and chip design remains high. There is an urgent need for an EDA learning course that enables quick entry. This project aims to create a general training program for comprehensive EDA talents, suitable for the technical stack training of iEDA team interns and the practical courses of EDA in colleges and universities. The aim is to lower the learning threshold of EDA and provide an EDA learning solution that is easy to get started with. After completing this project, learners will be able to understand the basic process of EDA development, initially master the knowledge of C++ and Rust programming languages, be familiar with the basic principles and processes of EDA tool development, understand the application of AI in EDA, and have the initial practical ability to develop basic-level EDA tool software and optimize EDA tools using AI technology.

::: info C++ Learning Module (Mandatory)

EDA tools are usually developed based on the C++ language. Due to the high performance and strong flexibility of C++, it is very suitable for developing complex electronic design automation software. Moreover, the EDA process involves a large number of algorithms and complex data structures, such as graph theory algorithms and geometric operations. The C++ language provides a rich standard template library (STL), which can help EDA engineers efficiently implement these algorithms and data structures.

::: info EDA Learning Module (Mandatory)

The basic knowledge of EDA is the core skill that EDA engineers must master, mainly including the basics of digital circuits, EDA foundation, and advanced EDA learning. The project mainly focuses on the development of EDA tools for digital circuits.

**EDA Foundation**
> The basics of digital circuits can help learners understand the basic concepts of digital circuits. The foundation of EDA can help learners understand the basic process of chip design;
>
> - Front-end: Requirements formulation, architecture design, functional design;
> - Back-end: Logic synthesis, physical design, sign-off analysis, physical verification;
> After completing the learning, learners can evaluate the parts they are more interested in for in-depth study and then participate in the specific tool development.

**EDA Advanced**
> After learners have studied the theoretical knowledge from books, this step will involve practical operation practice, that is, learners use the open-source iEDA tools developed by the project team to run the back-end process of chip design.
> During the practical operation, learners can intuitively feel the functions of each sub-tool in the back-end process by observing the changes of the layout in the previous and subsequent stages. At the same time, learners can think about the roles of the command scripts and parameters of each sub-tool.

::: info AI Learning Module (Optional)

EDA tools generate a large amount of design data and simulation data. Using AI's data mining and machine learning technologies can help EDA engineers conduct more intelligent and efficient optimizations in circuits design, layout and routing, power consumption optimization, and other links. EDA engineers' mastery of AI knowledge and skills will help improve the automation level of electronic product design, optimize the design quality, increase work efficiency, and thereby enhance the competitiveness of EDA tools.

:::

::: info Rust Learning Module (Optional)

 Rust is an emerging language with the characteristics of safety, high performance, and maintainability. Additionally, due to the good interoperability of Rust with C/C++, EDA engineers can implement new functions or optimize key parts on the existing C/C++ code basis using the Rust language to improve the performance and reliability of the entire EDA tool.
