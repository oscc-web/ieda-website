    A point with coordinates **(432.715, 171.114, 0.5879)** in layout.
    This point is generated on the surface of a region whose local normal vector is **(1, 0, 0)**.
    This local region is full of dielectric with a relative permittivity of **4.06**, except the region inner the conductor.
    The id of this region equals **1**.
    The selecting channel value of this point is **0**, such as non-target environment conductors. The details of the setting are related to the **Gauss Law-based Point Cloud feature**.
