<h3> An Open-Source AI-Aided Design Library for Design-to-Vector </h3>
</div>



## **Overview**

AiEDA is an open-source AI-native Electronic Design Automation (EDA) library that revolutionizes chip design workflows by introducing a unified design-to-vector methodology. Built on the iEDA infrastructure, it transforms diverse chip design data into standardized multi-level vector representations through modular engine integration, comprehensive data extraction frameworks, and hierarchical data management. AiEDA bridges traditional EDA tools with modern AI/ML techniques by providing complete physical design flows, programmatic data extraction capabilities, and standardized Python interfaces, establishing an AI-aided design (AAD) paradigm that enables seamless integration between EDA datasets and AI frameworks.
